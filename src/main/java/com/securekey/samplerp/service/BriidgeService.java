	 *     <li>Mobile SDK initiates request with briidge.net Enterprise
	 *     server.</li>
	 *     <li>briidge.net Enterprise server communicates with mobile SDK to
	 *     verify the device credential.</li>
	 *     <li>briidge.net Enterprise server generates a transaction
	 *     identifier for response retrieval and passes it to mobile SDK.</li>
	 *     <li>Mobile SDK passes transaction identifier to the RP mobile
	 *     application.</li>
	 *     <li>RP mobile application passes the transaction identifier to the
	 *     RP application server.</li>
	 *     <li>RP Application server makes call to briidge.net Enterprise
	 *     server to retrieve the response data.</li>
